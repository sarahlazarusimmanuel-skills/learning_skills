Polymorphism
Poly means many
morphism means different forms or behaviour
types of polymorphism
Compile Time Polymorphism
    (EARLY BINDING , Overloading  )
    Behaviour is defined as compile timme
    what we know
    we have two methods add(int , int )
    methods add(int , int , int )
    same name  different parameters
    which methods will be executed will be decided at compile time

Runtime Polymorphism
    (LATE BINDING , Overriding )
    Behaviour is defined at Runtime
    what will be decided at runtime
    Lets say we have two classes class A and class B .
    class B extends class A

class A {
  public void add(int , int );
}
class B extends class A {
    public void add(int , int);
}
In this we don't know which methods will be executed and this will be decided at runtime
same name same parameters
